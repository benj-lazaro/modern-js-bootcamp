Joining Paths
-------------
- To address the encountered error message "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory"
    - Triggered by lstat() reading the file or folder name ONLY, the path is NOT included
    - It attemps to read the files/folder from the current directory


- To solve this issue
    - Require another module named 'path' from the Node Standard Library
        - It provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
        - It handles cross-platform compatibility
        - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)

    - Specifically access the method path.join()
        - It joins all given path segments together
        - Using platform-specific separators as delimeters
        - Then normalize the resulting path
        - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#pathjoinpaths)
