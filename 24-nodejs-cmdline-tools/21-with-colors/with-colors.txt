console.log With Colors
-----------------------
- Implement code that will format the output of the application's console.log()
    - Use a 3rd-party NPM package named Chalk 
        - That formats the output of console.log() statements
        - Github repository (https://github.com/chalk/chalk)
        - NPM registry (https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)


    - To install

        npm install chalk


    - To verify
        - Open package.json and look at the "dependencies" section

        "dependencies": {
         "chalk": "^x.x.x"
        }

        - Inside the project folder, a new folder will be created named "node_modules"
            - This is where all of the installed dependencies are stored


- To use chalk in the current application
    - Require chalk just like what a normal Node Standard Library module 
        - Using require()

        const chalk = require("chalk");


- For the purposes of the application
    - Folders will be rendered as bold


- IMPORTANT: Use release 4.1.2 of chalk
    - Since v.5.0.0, the chalk package is a pure ESM package
        - Reference (https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)

    - Doing so requires a different manner of importing the package into the current codebase
        - Tested to conflict with existing require() statements

    - To rollback to version 4.1.2 (the last one that is NOT pure ESM)

        npm install chalk@4.1.2
