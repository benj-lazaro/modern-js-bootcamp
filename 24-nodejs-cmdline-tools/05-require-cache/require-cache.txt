The Require Cache
-----------------
- Expand how on the 'require' argument along with the module.exports works
    - Points out issues related to require() & the 'require cache'

- When running a JavaScript code in Node.js 
    - Node.js reads the JavaScript file
        - When it encounters a require() function with an argument value pointing to another file
            - It reads the code from that file
            - Automatically wraps the code in an invisible function
            - Then executes the invisible function
            - Simultaenously updates the 'require cache'

        - 'require cache' is an object that store the results of requiring in any file in a project
            - It holds the value(s) from a 'module.exports'

                - Technically, it stores the entire 'module' object 

                - That is passed as one of 5 argument values to the invisible function
                    - 'id'      = holds the full path & file of the required external JavaScript file
                    - 'exports' = holds the exported value from using 'module.exports'

            - It stores keys and its corresponding values
                - key   = name of the file that is passed to require() (e.g. 'myscript.js')
                - value = taken from a value assigned to 'module.exports'

    - Automatically wraps the content in an invisible function w/ argument values
    - Then executes the invisible function


- The issue
    - Whenever an attempt to execute a require() on the same external file for the nth time
        - Node.js will NOT re-read the content & execute the said file

        - Instead, it will look at the 'require cache'
        - Directly fetch the needed exported value(s) from it

    - NOTE: Node.js ONLY execute every file once (one single time)
        - Whatever data that is exported from an external file one single time
        - It then gets stored in 'require cache'
        - Consistently references the 'exports' property & its assigned value
            - Throughout the execution of the JavaScript code 
        
        - If the exported value changes over time within the external file
            - Those changes will NOT be reflected in the 'require cache'
