The process.cwd function
------------------------
- This method returns the current working directory (cwd, a string) of the Node.js process
    - It offers better cross-platform compatibility

    - By default, the 'process' module is automatically added into the global scope of every project
        - However recent documentation, suggest using require()

    - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processcwd)


Example
-------
const { cwd } = require('node:process');
console.log(`Current directory: ${cwd()}`);
