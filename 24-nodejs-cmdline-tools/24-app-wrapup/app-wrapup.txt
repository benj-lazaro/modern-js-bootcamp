App Wrapup
----------
- High points of this project is as follows:
    - Create a package.json file using the command

    npm init -y
    

    - Added a "bin" section in the package.json
        - Defines the command that will be executed on the local machine
        - Links and executes the code of the index.js
        
        - NOTE: This is NOT required for a normal Node.js application
            - It was done to run an CLI-based application as an executable file
            - A normal CLI-based Node.js app will be run using the following convention

            node <application_name>.js


    - Understand different Node.js Standard Library modules
        - file system
        - utils
        - path
    

    - Most of the functions from the Standard Library follow the the same format
        - Pass in a number of arguments

        - The last argument will be a callback function
            - Always going to be called with the same order of arguments
                - error (i.e. "err") object  
                - the actual data requested

        - Inside the callback function
            - Checks for an error, if there was, write code to handle it
            - Otherwise, continue on and use/process the data requested


    - Take the functions that rely upon callbacks
        - Wrap them around in a promise manually OR 
        - Pass it to util.promisify() OR
        - Use a sub-module to access the promise-based version of the given function directly
            - The 3rd option is NOT available to every function
