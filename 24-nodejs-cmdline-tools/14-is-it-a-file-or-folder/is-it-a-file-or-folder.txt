Is It A File Or Folder
----------------------
- Implement code to improve the formatting of the read files/folder from the current working directory
    - Provide color code to distinguish files from folders


- Require the fs.lstat() gets information about a file or folder at a time
    - Retrieves "fs.Stats" for the symbolic link referred to by the path
    
    - It requires two arguments (err, stats)
        - "err"     = error encountered when identifying a file or folder
        
        - "stats"   = is a "fs.Stats" object that identifies the item read as file or folder
            - It is an instance of the "fs.Stats" class
            
            - It comes with methods 
                - "stats.isDirectory()" = returns true if "fs.Stats" object describes a directory
                - "stats.isFile()"      = returns true if "fs.Stats" object describes a file
