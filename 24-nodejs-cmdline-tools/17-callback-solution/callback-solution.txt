Callback Solution
-----------------
- Implementation of the refactored callback solution 
    - Maintain an array of the results from each call to fs.lstat()
        - Each array item is initially assigned with the value of 'null'

    - As each callback is invoked, add the 'stats' object to the array

    - When the array is full (e.g. no more 'null' items)
        - console.log() everthing in it

    - NOTE: NOT ideal if there is a suceeding asynchronous call after the call for fs.lstat()
