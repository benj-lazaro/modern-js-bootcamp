Files Get Required Once
-----------------------
- An external file (JavaScript file) can ONLY be required once

- Reference the same external file for the 2nd time
    - Will NOT result to the same external file being read by Node.js 
    - Will NOT upload the exported data to the 'require cache'
    - Will continue to reference the current data from the 'require cache'
    - There is ONLY ONE instance of the exported data stored in the 'require cache'
