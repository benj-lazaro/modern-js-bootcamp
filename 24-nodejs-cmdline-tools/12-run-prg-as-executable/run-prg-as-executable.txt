Running A Node Program As An Executable
---------------------------------------
- To make a normal Node.js program to be an executable file requires multiple steps
    - The executable program will be named 'nls' (Node.js based 'ls' command)


- First step
    - Open terminal inside the project folder

    - Execute the command "npm init -y"
        - Automatically generate the file "package.json"

        - The package.json describes qualities about the Node.js app
            - Name
            - Version
            - Description

            - It has a 'scripts' section
                - Allows to write custom mini programs that automates tasks for the project

            - Keeps track of dependencies
                - Allows other users to automatically download & install dependencies
                - In order to use the Node.js on their computer


    - Open 'package.json' file
    - Add the following configuration to assign the executable name for the Node.js apppp
    
        "bin": {
        "<executable_name>": "<filename_node_js_app>.js"
        }


        Example
        -------
        "bin": {
        "nls": "index.js"
        }
