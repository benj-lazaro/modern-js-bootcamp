Executing JavaScript
--------------------
- Setup a little project to figure out how to run code with Node
    - Create a file named index.js 
    - Type the code / statement
       
        console.log("Hi there!");
        
    - Save contents


- To execute:
    - Open terminal on current (same) directory
    - Execute the command

        node index.js

    - Returns a string "Hi there!"


- Alternatively, JavaScript code can also run within Node
    - Open terminal on current (same) directory
    - Execute the Node REPL
    - Type the code / statement 
    
        console.log("Hi there!");

    - Press ENTER to execute the JavaScript code
    - Press CTRL+C (twice) to exit Node REPL

    - NOTE: This is similar to Python's REPL
