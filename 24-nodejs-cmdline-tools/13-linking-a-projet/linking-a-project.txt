Linking A Project
-----------------
- The next steps in making a Node.js app into an executable file


- Steps to make a Node.js app executable
    - Create a 'package.json'
        - Implementation the 'bin' section


    - Change 'index.js' file permission
        - Allows to run the file as though it is an actual executable
            - NOTE: This is NOT REQUIRED on a Windows machine

        chmod +x <node_app>.js


    - Add comment to 'index.js'
        - To allow it to be treated like an executable
            - NOTE: This is NOT REQUIRED on a Windows machine    

        - Go to the first line of code and add the following line        
            - NOTE: DO NOT put any COMMENT above this line
        
        #!/usr/bin/env node


    - Link the Node.js app to its executable name
        - On the terminal, type the command

        npm link


    - Test by typing the executable name 'nls' instead of 'node index.js'
