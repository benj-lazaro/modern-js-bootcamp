Accepting Command Line Arguments
--------------------------------
- Implement code that would allow the application to
    - Accept a path as an argument
    - Display the files & folders from the stated path


- Using 'process.argv'
    - It returns an array that contains items pointing to
        - Index 0   = /usr/bin/node
        - Index 1   = /usr/bin/<application_name> (app's symbolic link stored in /usr/bin)
        - Index 2   = passed argument value after the application application_name


- Refactor exisint code
    - To check upon execution if a path is given as argument
    - If none, defaults to the current working directory (i.e. process.cwd())
    - Reads the files and/or folder from the given path
        - NOTE: As of the time of this writing, the given path will trigger errors
