Issues With Sequential Reads
----------------------------
- Continuation with Method #3
    - Calls the Promise-based implementation of fs.lstat()

    const { lstat } = fs.promises;


    - NOTE: Every method in the "file system" module offers a Promise-based version
        - It return Promise objects instead of using a callback function
        - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api) 


- However, this solution (callback-promises) is NOT ideal
    - The issue with this approach is that everything runs in serial
        - i.e. perfoming sequential reads
    
    - It can only perform one operation at a time 
        - It can only go as fast as it takes to go through each file in series
        - It does NOT run multiple operationsi in parallel

    - To address this issue is to make use of Promise.all
        - A helper method that allows to process multple calls in parallel
        - A better approach in terms of performance
