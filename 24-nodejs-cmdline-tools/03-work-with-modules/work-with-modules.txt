Working With Modules
--------------------
- Focuses on how to get Node.js to share data between multiple different files

- JavaScript on the browser
    - Uses <script> tag defined in the HTML document
    - Multiple files meant multiple <script> tags

- JavaScript on Node.js
    - Uses require() on the main JavaScript file to import data from external files
        - Need to pass a relative path & the filename as an argument value

        - NOTE: require() is NOT part of the standard JavaScript API
            - It is a built-in function of Node.js
            - Reference (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9901082/what-is-require-in-javascript-and-nodejs)

    - On external files, require using module.exports
        - Declare the data to be exported
