The Callback Pattern in Node
----------------------------
- Implement code to use the readdir() function of the 'file system' module
    - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsreaddirpath-options-callback)


- It is extremely common in NodeJS functions to have the pattern of
    - Passing a callback function as the last argument
    - The 1st argument (of the callback function) is an error of some kind (err)
    - The 2nd or 3rd argument being the actual data being accessed or the action to be accomplished

    - NOTE: Exception are functions that have the word 'sync' on it's name (e.g. fs.readdirSync())
