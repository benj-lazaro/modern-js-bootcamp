Promise.all Solution
--------------------
- The final and favored implementation
    - Create an array to store 'stat' objects


    - Wraps the fs.lstat() in a Promise


    - Use async/await and Promise.all() method
        - To process individual calls to fs.lstat() in parallel
        - Throw the returned data from each Promise into the array

        - NOTE: Promise.all() is a built-in method of JavaScript
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)


    - Wait for every item in the array to have some data inside


    - Process each item in the array
