Data Storage
------------
- To create a persistent data store to save details when creating an "admin" account
    - Persistent = to store data and be readily available after the next restart of the web server

    - To have the Express web server to interface with a data store
        - Data store contains the list of "admin" accounts and products to sell

        - Data store saves the data locally on the hard drive
            - In the form of a JSON files
                - products.json = products to sell
                - users.json    = admin accounts
    
    - Implement the data store from scratch
        - NOTE: This data store is NOT SUITABLE for production use for the following reasons:
            - It will trigger an error when opening / writing to the same file twice at the same time   

            - It will NOT WORK if multiple web servers running on different machines
                - Each machine will have their own version of the JSON files

            - It will have to write to the filesystem EVERYTIME it has to update some data
                - Impacting the performance of the application
