Signup Validation Logic
-----------------------
- Refactor the index.js code that handles the POST request for the root route
    - Calls the method(s) from the class UsersRepository

    - Implement the following checks
        - Did the user already sign up with this email?
            - If yes, show an error

        - Are the password and password confirmation strings different?
            - If yes, show an error
        
        - Otherwise, proceed in creating a user (admin) account
