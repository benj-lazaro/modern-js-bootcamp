Implementing The Users Repository
---------------------------------
- Create a user's repository to model all user (admin) accounts that will be created
    - Save user account details on the file users.json
        - email account
        - password


- Implement a class named "UsersRepository"
    - On a separate directory and file
    - Located at repositories/users.js


- Use the method fs.accessSync()
    - To check for the existence of (and access to) a file synchronously (no callback involved)
    - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsaccesssyncpath-mode)

    - NOTE: From a performance standpoint, using .accessSync() is NOT advisable in general
        - However this method is ONLY called ONCE throughout the entire lifecycle of the app
        - So it is NOT the worst thing in the world

    - The normal and promise version of.accessSync() is NOT recommended
        - It is called within the confines of a constructor function
        - Constructor functions are NOT allowed to be async in nature


- Use the method fs.writeFileSync()
    - To create the user repository file if it does NOT exists
    - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options)
