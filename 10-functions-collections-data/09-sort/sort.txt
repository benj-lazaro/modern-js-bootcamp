.sort() Method
--------------
- The .sort() method sorts the elements of an array IN PLACE
    - Returns the reference to the same array, now sorted

- Time and space complexity of the sort CAN NOT be guaranteed
    - It depends on the implementation

- To sort array elements WITHOUT MUTATING the array
    - Use .toSorted() method

    - An alternative, use .slice() without passing any argument value
        - Creates a copy of the original array

- The default sort order is ascending
    - .sort() method converts the array elements into strings
    - Then sort them according to the element's UTF-16 code unit value

- To sort numbers according to their numerical value; use .sort() method & a user-defined compare function
    - The compare function accepts two argument values namely a & b
        - Then perform a mathematical subtraction on a - b

    - If the difference is less than 0
        - The .sort() method places the value in a before b
        
    - If the difference is equal to 0
        - The .sort() method leaves the values in a and b unchanged

    - If the difference is greater than 0
        - - The .sort() method places the value in b before a
