Arrow Function Implicit Return
------------------------------
- A more compact way of writing arrow functions
    - Known as the one-liner implicit return
    - Does NOT require writing the keyword 'return'

- Applicable for arrow functions that accepts a single parameter & a single line of expression
    - Replaces the pair of ( ) with a pair of { }

- A more compact arrow function with a single parameter & line of expression
    - Drops the pair of ( ) 
    - Place the single line of expression right after the =>

    - NOTE: if the single expression is too long or hard to read
        - Break it the expression into multiple lines as appropriate
        - Enclose the expressions within a pair of ( )

    - It is a nice feature when needed a simple arrow function
        - A single short expression to be returned

- In the event that the body of the arrow function contains conditional statements or multiple expressions
    - An arrow function with implict return can NOT be used


Syntax
------
param => (
    expression
);

param => expression;
