Objects & Reference Types
-------------------------
- Arrays and Objects stored in a variable does NOT hold the actual value
    - It holds the reference to the actual array or Objects
    - Arrays & Objects are reference type of data

- The keyword 'const' is used if the variable storing the reference for arrays & objects
    - Is expected NOT be changed within the program flow
    - This still allows to add or remove object properties
    - This still allows to change a value in an array or object property

- The keyword 'let' is used if the variable storing the reference for arrays & objects 
    - Is expected to be changed later in the program flow
