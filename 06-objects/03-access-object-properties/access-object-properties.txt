Accessing Object Properties
---------------------------
- Keys are used to access the properties of an object
- Keys are automatically converted into string, EXCEPT for symbols

- The [ ] are used to access object properties (i.e. keys) that are NOT valid JavaScript identifiers (e.g. numbers)


Syntax
------
<object_name>.<key>;        // Using dot-notation for accessing an object property

<object_name>[<key>];       // Using [] to access a property that might NOT use a valid JavaScript identifier

let <new_object_property_name> = <new_object_property_value>;   // Using a variable to hold the object property in order to serve
<object_name>[<new_object_property_name>]                       // as a dynamic as key & access the corresponding property
