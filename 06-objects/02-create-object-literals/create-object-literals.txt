Creating Object Literals
------------------------
- Much like an array, storing an object to a variable
    - It stores a reference (address) to the actual object value in memory
    - It does NOT STORE the actual object value

- An object can store all data types as a value to their corresponding keys
    - Including refernce data types e.g. arrays & other objects

- To access specific properties of an object, access it using the corresponding key
    - All valid keys are converted to strings 
    - EXCEPT for symbols


Syntax
------
- An empty object literal declaration

const <variable_name> = {

};


- An object literal declaration with properties (key:value pairs)

const <variable_name> = {
    <key>: <value>,
    <key>: <value>,
    <key>: <value>,
    ...
};
