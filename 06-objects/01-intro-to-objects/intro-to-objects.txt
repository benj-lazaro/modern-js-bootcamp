Intro To Objects
----------------
- An object allows to store data where it can group associated things & group pieces of data together
    - It is simply a container
    - It contains related information in the form of key-value pairs
    - A key is used to access the associated value

- Objects are a collection of properties
    - Properties are a key-value pair
    - Rather than accessing data using an index, custom keys are used instead

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)

- NOTE: JavaScript object = Python dictionary
