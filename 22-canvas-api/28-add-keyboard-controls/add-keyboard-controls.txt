Adding Keyboard Controls
------------------------
- Implement code that changes the movement of the ball
    - Based on the key that has been pressed by the user

    - Checks the current velocity of the ball
        - Velocity = speed in which the ball is moving
        - Updates the current velocity in the up, right, down or left directions

    - To change the velocity of a shape
        - Use the matter.js structure 'Body'
            - Contains functions that allows to update properties inside of a shape
                - It's position, velocity, rotation, etc.
