Drawing The Goal
----------------
- Implement the code that renders the 'goal'
    - Located at the bottom-right corner of the grid (maze)

    - Adjust / scale the size of the 'goal' accordingly 
        - Based on the pre-defined unit length
        - Unit length = size of each individual 'cell'

- Reduce the size of the 'walls' (borders)
    - Change from 40 to 2
    - To address the visual 'conflict' with the horizontal & vertical walls
        - When the size of the grid (maze) increases
