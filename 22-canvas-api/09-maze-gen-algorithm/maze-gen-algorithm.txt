Maze Generation Algorithm
-------------------------
- To generate or 'build' a maze 
    - Create a grid of 'cells'
        - A 'cell' represents the space that a user can visit

        - Build a 2D array
            - To represent the grid of cells

        - Pick a random starting cell
            - From the grid of cells

    - Then from the starting cell
        - Build a randomly-ordered list of neighbors
            - Then randomly pick a neighbor cell to visit (*)

        - If a neighbor cell has been visited (by the user) before
            - Remove the cell from the randomly-order list of cells to visit next
    
        - For each remaining neighbor cell
            - The user moves into the picked neighbor cell to visit
            - Then remove the wall between the previous cell and the visited cell

        - Repeat for this process for that new neighbor (*)
            - After moving into picked neighbor cell

    - In the event that there is no possible moves to make (yet there are available cells to consume)
        - The user 'backtrack' to previous moves (or visited cells)
            - Until an unvisited neighbor cell is found
            - Repeat the process for that new neighbor cell
