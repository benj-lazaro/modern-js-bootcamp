Boilerplate Overview
--------------------
- Discusses the boilerplate code in detail

- The Render.create()
    - Dynamically creates a <canvas> element in the DOM 
        - The <canvas> element is used to draw any kind of arbitrary shape 

    - To assign the <canvas> element's height & width
        - An 'options' object is passed to along with properties 'element' & 'engine'
            - Container properties of 'width' and 'height'


- The Bodies object comes with a method that defined any shape (e.g. rectangle)
    - The object that comes with the defined shaped is then saved in the variable 'shape'
    - It contains a representation of all of the different shapes inside of the World object

    - The 'options' object with the property 'isStatic' assigned with the value of 'true'
        - Instructs the shape to be not movable (static) within the World object

        - Assigning a 'false' value or removing the 'isStatic' property
            - The shape will be fall down beyond the bottom of the World object
            - By default, the 'gravity' property is enabled

    - The values passed as arguments to the shape method (e.g. .rectangle()) of the Bodies
        - The first two numbers 
            - Refers to the X & Y coordinates
            - Measured starting from the top-left corner of the World object

        - Thw next two numbers 
            - Refers to the height and width (in pixels) of the defined shape


- To display (render) the defined shape on the World object
    - Call the .add() method
    - Pass the variables 'world' and 'shape'
