Application Overview
--------------------
- The project is a little maze game
    - Runs directly inside the browser

    - Upon start-up
        - It shows the user a maze

    - The user manipulates a ball
        - Controlled by 'WASD' keys

    - Move the ball around the maze
        - Until it reaches the target location (Green square)
        - Touching the target location, wins the game


- Big challenges (and how to address them)
    - How do we generate a maze?
        - Many available algorithms to generate a maze
        - Have to learn about tree data structure and recursion
            - To implement the simpliest algorithm

    - How are we going to draw this thing (maze) on the screen (browser)?
        - Use matter.js to draw the maze onto a canvas 
            - It is a 2D physics engine for the web
            - It simulates physical elements (e.g. ball, spring, board, etc.)
            - Reference (https://brm.io/matter-js/)

    - How do we make some keyboard keys to control the ball?
        - matter.js has the ability to map key presses to movements of shapes

    - How do we detect when the ball touches the Green square (target location)?
        - matter.js has the ability to detect collission between shapes
            - Report the collissions as events
