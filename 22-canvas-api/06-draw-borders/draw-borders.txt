Drawing Borders
---------------
- Draw rectangles at the top, right, bottom and left of the World object's borders
    - To serve as a walls around the World object
    - To prevent shapes from 'flying off' outside

- Add a rectangle shape into the World object
    - To serve as a sort of crash dummy
    - The shape's 'isStatic' property is turned off (i.e. set to false or undefined)
    - To check if the walls prevent the shape from 'flying off' outside the World object
