Guiding Comments
----------------
- Next is to code on how to pick a random starting 'cell' within the grid (maze)
    - For the 3x3 grid, generate a random pair of values ranging between 0 and 2

- To generate the coordinates of the starting 'cell'
    - Multiply the value of variable cell to the value of Math.random()
    - Round the product to the lowest integer using Math.floor()
    - Assign the rounded down product to their corresponding variables
        - startRow
        - startColumn

- Write a function named stepThroughCell()
    - Implement the algorithm / pseudo-code as comments in index.js
