Guiding Comments
----------------
- Prepare initial code on picking a random starting 'cell'
    - For the current 3x3 grid
        - Generate a random pair of numbers ranging from 0 to 2

- The random pair of values will serve as the starting 'cell' coordinates
    - Multiply the value of the variable 'cells' to the number generated by Math.random()
    - Round down the product using Math.floor()
    - Perform this operation twice and save the value to the corresponding variables
        - startRow
        - startColumn

- Write a function stepThroughCell()
    - Accepts two integer values from startColumn & startRow
    - Implements the algorithm that handles a user passing through a cell within the maze
        - Currently implement as comments or pseudo-code
