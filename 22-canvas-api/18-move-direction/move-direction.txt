Determining Movement Direction
------------------------------
- Implement code that iterates through the randomize list of neighboring 'cells'
    - Surrounding the starting 'cell'

    - Update the variable 'neighbors' to include a 3rd item on each sub-array
        - This provides the direction where the user will be heading
