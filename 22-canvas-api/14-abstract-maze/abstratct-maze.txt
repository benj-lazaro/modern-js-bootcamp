Abstracting Maze Dimensions
---------------------------
- Abstract hard-coded values used in generating the dimensions of the maze to be generated
    - Specifically those that are used in the following constant variables
        - grid
        - verticals
        - horizontals

    - Assigning the hard-coded value of 3 (representing number of cells in a 3x3 grid)
        - Into a configuration variable named 'cell'

        - This makes setting the size of the grid easier
            - Prevents breaking the code by a typo when hard-coding the value
