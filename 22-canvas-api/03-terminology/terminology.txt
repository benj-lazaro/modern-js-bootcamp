matter.js Terminology
---------------------
- Important pieces of terminology in matter.js
    - World
        - Object that contains all of the different 'things' (shapes) in our matter.js app
        - It tracks the location, position, speed, velocity, etc. of each shape
        - It takes a snapshot of the shapes in an instant in time

    - Engine
        - An object that has a bunch of different functions
        - It reads in the current state of the World object
        - Then calculates changes in positions of all the different 'things' (shapes)
        - It is responsible for transitioning from one snapshot to another

    - Runner
        - It is responsible for making the Engine and World objects to work together
        - Runs about 60 times per second
            - Until the Engine object process all of the data stored inside the World object

    - Render
        - Whenever the Engine object processes an update
        - Render will take a look at all different shapes 
            - Then show (render) all of them on the screen (browser)

    - Body
        - A shape that gets displayed (rendered) on screen (browser)
        - We can create a body that represents a circle, rectangle, oval, etc.
            - It can create any arbitrary shapred polygon
