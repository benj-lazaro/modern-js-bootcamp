More On Maze Generation
-----------------------
- Maze = 2-D grid array containing neighboring 'cells'
    - It would a number of columns & rows

    - In-between each neighboring 'cell' is a wall
        - vertical      = placed between two neighboring cells on the same row 
        - horizontal    = placed between two neighboring on the same column 

    - Two additional 2-D arrays will be added into the code
        - To keep track of both the horizontal and vertical walls
            - Variable 'verticals'   = keeps track of the vertical walls
            - Variable 'horizontals' = keeps track of the horizontal walls

        - These arrays will contain boolean values
            - 'true'    = no wall (an open space for the user to 'walk' into)
            - 'false    = there is a wall between neighboring 'cells'
