Understanding The New Unit Variables
------------------------------------
- Refactor the codebase to make the grid (maze) to display properly
    - Accordingly to the user's screen dimensions

- To generate the number of cells on the horizontal and vertical direction
    - Replace variable 'cells' with 2 new ones
        - 'cells' = number of cells in the horizontal & vertical direction
        - 'cellsHorizontal' = defines the number of cells in the horizontal direction
        - 'cellsVertical' = defined the number of cells in the vertical direction

- To accomodate the size of cells on the horizontal and vertical direction
    - Replace variable 'unitLength' with 2 new ones
        - 'unitLengthX' = defines the width of a cell
        - 'unitLengthY' = defines the height of a cell

        - To calculate the unitLength of a cell
            - Take the current window height & width
            - Divide that number with 'cellsHorizontal' & 'cellsVertical' respectfully

            const unitLengthX = width / cellsHorizontal;
            const unitLengthY = height / cellsVertical;
