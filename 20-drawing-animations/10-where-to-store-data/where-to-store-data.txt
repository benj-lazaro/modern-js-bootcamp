Where To Store Data
-------------------
- Option #1
    - Stores the timer data in an instance variable within the class

    - Create an Event Listener to 'listen' for input in the text input
        - For changes in the initial timer value
        - Any changes will require updating the initial timer value within tick() instance method

    - The current popular choice of approach in storing timer data


- Option #2 (author's choice)
    - Stores the timer data (time left) into the DOM (input element)
    - Offers better UX (User eXperience)

    - Removes the creation of an Event Listener to 'listen' for input in the text input
        - For changes in the initial timer value
        - Relies on the data written in the text input instead

    - Former choice of approach in storing timer data
        - To demonstrate the downsides of this approach
