Advanced Circle Properties
--------------------------
- Attrubutes of the <circle> shape
    - 'fill'                = refers to the inside of the circle, kind of like the content
    
    - 'stroke'              = refers to the border of the circle
        - Starts rendering from the right-hand side
        - Draws around the circle clockwise

    - 'stroke-width'        = sets the border thickness

    - 'storke-dasharray'    = sets the length of each dash & gap around the border ('stroke')
        - Accepts two values, the 2nd optional value refers to the gap size
        - Assigning a singe value, automatically sets the length of dash & gap as equal

    - 'stroke-dashoffset'   = introduces a whitespace around the border ('stroke')

    - NOTE: These attributes IMPLICITLY use pixels as the unit of measurement

- To make the circle's fill transparent
    - Assign the value of 'transparent' to the element's attribute 'fill'

- To calculate the entire perimeter of a circle, use the formula
    
    perimeter = 2 * PI * radius

    - Perimeter = the total length of the outside edge of a circle
    - Radius    = the length from the center point of a circle to its outside edge

- The <circle> attributes 'stroke-dasharray' and 'stroke-dashoffset'
    - Will be used to perform the animated border of the timer web application
