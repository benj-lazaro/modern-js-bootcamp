Rules Of SVG
------------
- Define a <svg> element in the HTML document
    - Assign values to the element's attributes 'height' and 'width'
    - This serves as a canvas size for the shape that will be rendered within 
 
- Define the shape that will be rendered within the <svg> element
    - Use the element's shape name (e.g. <circle>, <polygon>, <elipse>, <square>, etc.)
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element)

- Position the shape within the bounds of the <svg> element using x and y-coordinates
    - NOTE: The top-left corner of the <svg> element = origin 
        - The coordinates of the origin
            - x-axis = 0 
            - y-axis = 0

    - Position the center point of the shape using the element's attributes
        - 'cx'  = coordinate x-axis (increases from left to right)
        - 'cy'  = coordinate y-axis (increases from top to bottom)

- For the shape <circle>
    - Set the radius by assigning value to the attribute
        - 'r' = radius
        
        - The radius starts from the center point out to the edge of the circle
        - The diameter refers to the full distance from one edge to the opposite edge of the circle
    
    - Position the center point of the circle from the origin using the attributes 
        - 'cx'  = coordinate x-axis
        - 'cy'  = coordinate y-axis
