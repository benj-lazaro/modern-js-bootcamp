The Secret To The Animation
---------------------------
- How to use the attributes 'stroke-dasharray' and 'stoke-dashoffset'
    - In order to animate the <circle> element's border

- Based on the final product, presents the following challenges
    - The 'stroke-dashoffset' starts at the top of the <circle>
        - Against the default of starting at the right-hand side
        - To address this, rotate the <circle> -90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction 
            - Use the attribute 'transform'
            - Assign the value 'rotate(-90 100 100)'
                - -90       = angle of rotation
                - 100 100   = center point of the <circle>

    - The 'stroke-dashoffset' runs in a clockwise direction
        - Against its default of running in a counter-clockwise direction
        - To address this, assign a negative value
