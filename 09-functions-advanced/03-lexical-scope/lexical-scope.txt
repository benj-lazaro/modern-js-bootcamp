Lexical Scope
-------------
- It refers to the fact that nested functions are lexically bound
    - Inner functions are bound to the scope of their parent function
    - Inner functions has access to the variables defined in the outer function
    - Outer function has NO access to the variables define within their inner functions

- The logic behind the lexical scope
    - When an inner function executes a line of code that required access to a variable

    - It looks up if the said variable is available within its local scope

    - If the named variable is NOT available, it searches for the variable on its parent function
        - If such variable exists, it accesses the value assigned to that variable

    - Outer functions has NO access to the variables defined within inner functions
