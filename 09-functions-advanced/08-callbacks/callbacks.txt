Callbacks
---------
- It is a function passed into another function as an argument value
    - To be invoked within the outer (separately defined) function

- Anonymous functions are often used for functionality is needed ONLY ONCE
    - There is no need to declare a function for it


Example
-------
function callTwice(func) {
    func();
    func();
}

function laugh() {
    console.log("Ha! Ha! Ha!");
}


callTwice(laugh);   // laugh is the callback function; passed as an argument & then call within another function (callTwice)
