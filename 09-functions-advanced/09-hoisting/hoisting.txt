Hoisting
--------
- It is an odd behavior in JavaScript

- On variables declared using keyword var
    - Automatically 'hoist' the variable declaration prior to the line of code that call / use it
    - Despite the variable actually declared below the line that call / use it
    - To prevent it, make sure to declare and initialize variables before using them

- On variables declared using keywords let and const
    - It does NOT support hoisting
    - It returns a ReferenceError
    - NOTE: keywords 'let' and 'const' exists to REMEDY hoisting

- On function declaractions
    - It supports hoisting
    - JavaScript 'hoists' all function declaractions to the beginning of the code

- On function expressions
    - It does NOT support hoisting


Example
-------
console.log(animal);    // Returns undefined; there is no assigned value yet but JavaScript 'hoists' up the variable declaration
var animal = "Tapir";   // as if it was declared to the line of code prior to the console.log()
