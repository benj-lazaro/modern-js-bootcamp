Hashing Passwords
-----------------
- To address a security issue of storing a user's password in plaintext


- To address this issue
    - Store the user's password in a different format using hashing algorithms (e.g. SHA256)


- CONS of hashing algorithms
    - No matter how many time a string of text is run through a hashing algorithm
        - It will ALWAYS yield the same hash string 

    - It does NOT WORK in REVERSE
        - Using a hashed string as input
        - Will NOT produce its plaintext equivalent


- Goal is to refactor the code
    - Provide the capacity to store a user's password in hashed format
        - Then save it into the users.json file

    - When logging in, run through the user's password into a hashing algorithm
        - Compare the result with the save hash string in the users.json file
        - If match hash strings matches, the user is allowed to login
