Creating User Records
---------------------
- Create a user record in the user.json
    - This represents a user
        - The ID will later be used in identifying the user on succeeding requests to the server

    - Stores the generated ID of a user inside the user's cookie

    - Use a 3rd-party package "cookie-session"
        - Reference (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session)
        - Repository (https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session)

        - To install

            npm install cookie-session

        - Manages important information stored inside a user's cookie
            - Doing it manually is notoriously tricky
            - Increases risk of leaking sensitive information to malicious users      
        
    - Implement a cooked-based authentication flow


- Refactor the following code 
    - POST request handler for the root route (index.js)
    - . create() method of the UsersRepository class (users.js)
