Signing In
----------
- Implement code for the POST request handler for the "signin" route


- Basic algorithm
    - Check for the user's email address
        - If it does NOT EXISTS, show an error

    - Check if the user's password matches
        - If it does NOT MATCH, show an error

    - Otherwise, sign in the user into the web application
