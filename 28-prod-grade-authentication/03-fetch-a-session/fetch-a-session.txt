Fetching A Session
------------------
- Implement the code that will store a user's ID inside a cookie
    - Using a 3rd-party package named "cookie-session"
    - Reference (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session)


- To wire-up the "cookie-session" into the project
    - Require it using require()

    - Call it using app.use()
        - Pass cookieSession() as an argument value
        - Effectively call it like a function

    - Pass a configuration object as an argument value to cookieSession()
        - The object contains a single item
            - A key named "keys"
            - An array value containing a single item
                - A string of random string of characters
                - Serves as an encryption key
                - To encrypt information stored inside a cookie

    - Doing so willl add an additional property to the "req" object
        - Namely the req.session
            - A plain JavaScript object
            - It can accept as many properties

        - When calling res.send()
            - "cookie-session" library looks into the information stored req.session
                - Information is automatically maintained by the "cookie-session" library

            - It encodes that information into a simple string

            - Then attach the string to the outgoing response as the cookie 
                - Stored on the user's browser
