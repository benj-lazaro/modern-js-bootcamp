String Indices
--------------
- Strings are indexed
- Each character has a corresponding index (positional number) based off its position in the string

- String indices starts from the left and progressing towards the right of a string
- The lowest index value is 0
- The index value increments by 1 as to move towards the last character of its string

- A string value has a property named .length
- The property .length returns the number of chracters of its string


Syntax
------
<string_value>[<string_index>];
- It returns the character residing on the specificed index
- Otherwise, returns 'undefined' whicn means that there is no character on the specified index

<string_value>[<string_value>.length - 1]
- It returns the last character of the string


Example
-------
"chicken"                   // Index value of 0 = 'a'; index value of 6 = 'n'
"          "                // Index value of 0 = ' '; index value of 10 = ' '

> "chicken".length
< 7
> "          ".length       // A space is considered a character in a string
< 10

let mySong = "Surfin' USA"; // Assign a string to a variable
> mySong.length;
< 11                        // Returns the length of the string

> mySong[0]                 // Access the character at index 0
< "S"
> mySong[2]                 // Access the character at index 2
< "r"
> mySong[11]                // Access the character at index 11
< undefined

> mySong[0] = "D"           // Assigns 'D' as the 1st character of the string value in mySong
< "D"
> mySong
< "Surfin' USA"             // String remains unchanges because it is IMMUTABLE
