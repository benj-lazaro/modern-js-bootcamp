Introduction To OOP
-------------------
- OOP is a pattern of creating a repeatable recipe (or class / object template)
    - For other objects to be created based of this recipe

- To create a new object based of a class
    - Uses the 'new' keyword prior to the class name
    - Returns an object that contains methods and properties defined in the class
