What On Earth Are Prototypes
----------------------------
- The prototype is the template object by which a JavaScript object inherits features from
    - Features = methods and properties

- It serves as a blueprint / template object
    - It contains a bunch of methods and properties

    - New objects that instantiated from the same prototype object
        - Inherits the methods and properties

- There is one object that serve as the PROTOTYPE for other types of object
    - The prototype object is referenced as having an uppercase first letter
        - e.g. Array, String

- The __proto__ or [[Prototype]] property in JavaScript objects
    - Is a special property that provides a reference to the JavaScript object's prototype object
    - It lists the inherited methods and properties from the prototype object
    - This is NOT the actual prototype object

    - NOTE: It is very rare to tinker with the __proto__ property
    - Often the actual prototype object is directly accessed & manipulated with

- You can create / instantiate multiple objects that share the same prototype object
    - These new objects will contain the inherited methods & properties
    - Without each object having their individual copies of these inherited features
