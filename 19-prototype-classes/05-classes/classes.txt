Classes
-------
- Classes are a template for creating objects
    - Encapsulates data with code to work on that data

    - They are built on prototypes 
        - But have their own unique syntax & semantics
        
    - It offers a better way of creating object than a Constructor Function
        - Syntatic sugar of prototypes (see Constructor Functions notes)
        - Syntatic sugar = cleaner, cuter way of writing something

    - It defines the prototype's properties and methods in a single class
        - Removes the separation of the Constructor Function's properties from its methods

- When defining a Class
    - Use 'class' keyword followed by a name with its 1st letter in uppercase

    - Add a 'constructor' within the Class 
        - It is a function that automatically executes whenever the class is instantiated into an object
        - This is a MUST HAVE whenever defining a Class
        - Similar to that of a Constructor Function

        - Define the Class' properties

    - Define the Class' method(s) right after the constructor
