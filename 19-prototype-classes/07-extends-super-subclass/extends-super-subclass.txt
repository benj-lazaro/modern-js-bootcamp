Extends, Super and Subclasses
-----------------------------
- The 'extends' keyword is used in class declarations / expressions to create a class

- It extends the properties and functionalities defined in the parent class
    - To its children class or subclass

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends)


Syntax
------
class ChildClass extends ParentClass { /* â€¦ */ }


- The 'super' keyword is used to access properties on an object literal or class' [[Prototype]]
    - As well as to invoke a superclass' constructor

- It basically access the parent class' properties defined within its 'constructor'

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)


Syntax
------
super([arguments]) // calls the parent constructor.
super.propertyOnParent
super[expression]


- The keywords 'extends' and 'super' both have to do with subclasses
    - Essentially inheritance = a way of sharing functionality between classes
