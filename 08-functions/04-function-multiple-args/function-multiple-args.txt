Function With Multiple Arguments
--------------------------------
- A parameter is a variable that is defined during function declaration
    - Variables placed within the pair of ( )
    - Serve as a placeholder for the input(s) of a function

- The order that the parameters are defined in a function declaration matter
    - It dictates the order that they are filled in from left to right

- An argument is the actual value that is passed into a function
    - When calling or executing a function within a program
    - A missing argument will AUTOMATICALLY have the value of undefined by JavaScript
