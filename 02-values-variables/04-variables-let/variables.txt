Variables
---------
- They are like "labeled jars" for a value in JavaScript
- You can store a value & then give it a name
- So that you can recall it, use it or change the value by name


Syntax
------
let <variable_name> = <value>;


Example
-------
let numOfHens = 4;
numOfHens = 1;              // This does NOT change the value stored in variable hens

numOfHens = numOfHens - 1;  // This CHANGES the value stored in variable hens


Variable Name Convention
------------------------
- Variable names are to be written in Camel case
    * Lowercase the 1st letter of the 1st word
    * Capitalize the 1st letter of each suceeding word
