Example
-------
score = score + 10;         // Without using an unary operator
score += 1                  // Using an unary operator

let bonusMultiplier = 3;
score = 150;
score *= bonusMultiplier;   // Multiply score with bonusMultiplier; result is 450

let counter = 0;
counter++;                  // Increments the value of counter by 1
counter--;                  // Decrements the value of counter by 1
