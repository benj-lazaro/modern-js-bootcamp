    - To create an autocomplete widget that is entirely re-usable in nature
        - Can easily swap out source of data (API)
        - Has render option that contains configuration data for the widget

    - Locate the root HTML element
        - Where the retrieve data from an API will be generated
        - Within the code of the widget

    - How to implement the statistical value comparison appropriately
        - In the movieTemplate()
            - Upfront extract movie statistical values from the returned object
            - Store the values inside the DOM 
            - Pull the values from the DOM using a helper function runComparison()
                - Then referencing the appropriate data-set.values 
                - Perform a simple comparison operation
                    - Apply corresponding CSS style
