Implementing A Reusable Debounce
--------------------------------
- Create a debounce function
    - Make it modular that can be used for other functions


- Use the debounce() to call onInput()
    - Prevents repetitive calls to onInput() after every keypress
    - Makes a request to the OMDb after a defined delay after the last keypress
