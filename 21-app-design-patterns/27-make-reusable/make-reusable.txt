Making The Autocomplete Reusable
--------------------------------
- To make the autocomplete widget reusable 
    - Refactor current codebase
    - Divide it into two parts
        - index.js
        - autocomplete.js


- The index.js:
    - Contains non-reusable code for our very specific project

    - It handles the config for the autocomplete.js
        - fetchData()       = function to find movies
        - renderOption()    = function that knows how to render a movie
        - onOptionSelect()  = function that gets invoked when a user clicks an option (specific movie)
        - root              = element that the autocomplete should be rendered into

        - Saved as an object to be passed off to autocomplete.js


- The autocomplete.js:
    - Super reusable code to get an autocomplete widget to work
        - It must have zero knowledge on the specifics that it receives from the API
        - It must be able to run several times in the same project
        - It must be 100% reusable
            
    - It has a function that 
        - Takes a autocomplete config object (from index.js)
            - Process the option's 4 properties inside the object

        - Then renders an autocomplete widget on screen
