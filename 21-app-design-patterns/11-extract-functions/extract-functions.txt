Extracting Utility Functions
----------------------------
- Extract 'utility' function(s) from the index.js file
    - Create a separate JavaScript file named utils.js
    - Paste the reusable debounce function
    - Succeeding utility functions will be placed within this file

- In the index.html file
    - Place the line <script src="utils.js"></script> before <script src="index.js"></script>
    
    - To ensure the the 'utility' function(s) will be loaded first
        - And referenced by the code within index.js during runtime

- This is to organize the code inside the project
    - Better than placing the entire lengthy code within index.js
