Issues With The Codebase
------------------------
- Serious issues with the current implementation
    - All code touches everything
        - Every function & block of code 'reaches' around other variables 
            - Inside the file
            - Inside other functions           

    - Autocomplete widget was supposed to be reusable
        - Current codebase revolves around the autocomplete widget
        - Current codebase is NOT reusable

    - Autocomplete has knowledge of what a movie object is
        - It has internal code knows the 'movie' data it is currently processing
            - This make the code NOT reusable for other projects
            - The code requires to be refactored when working with other forms of data

    - Autocomplete has knowledge of what to show for each option
        - It knows specific details on what to display for every option
        - The code requires to be refactored when working with other forms of data

    - Autocomplete has knowledge of what to do when a movie is clicked
        - It has a direct reference to the movieFunction()
            - A code that performs a new request to OMDb API for a specific movie

        - It has specific details on movie title to request to the OMDb API
        - The code requires to be refactored when working with other forms of data

    - Many global variables that refer to specific elements
        - It makes it difficult to show a 2nd autocomplete widget on the screen
            - Current code will require duplicate the most of the codebase twice
                - Update the 2nd codebase to reference the DOM elements for the 2nd widget
                - Update the DOM elements' attribute 'id"
                - Update the associated variable names


- The end goal is to write reusable code
    - Eliminate the need to duplicate code
    - Arbitrarily change the variable names of the duplicated code
