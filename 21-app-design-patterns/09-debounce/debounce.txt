Understanding Debounce
----------------------
- The process of waiting for the last keypress before sending a request to the OMDb API
    - Is referred as 'debouncing an input'

    - Waiting for some time to past after the last event to actually do something

- Implement a refactor on the onInput()
    - To make it reusable
    - Current code is hard to read & understand 
    - Hide the implementation of the actual debouncing logic

- Action plan
    - Create a new helper function named debounce()
        - It accepts a callback function
        - It returns a new onInput() function

    - The new onInput() function       
        - It is a wrapper function that restrict calls to the original onInput()
        - It allows access to the onInput() only after a certain period of time passes
        - The onInput() within this wrapper is the same as the original onInput()
