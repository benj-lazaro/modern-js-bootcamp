Big Challenges
--------------
- Challenging aspects of the project
    - Need to fetch data about movies
        - Use JavaScript to fetch movie data from an external movie-related API
            - OMDb API, The Open Movie Database (https://omdbapi.com/)
            - Offers the option to search and be able to return
                - An index result   = listing of related movie titles (limited information = id & title)
                - A show result     = every attribute of the movie

    - Build an autocomplete widget from scratch
        - List of rules on how autocomplete works

    - Better styling in CSS
        - Use Bulma CSS framework (https://bulma.io/)
        - Already 'wired' up in the HTML document that came with starter kit
