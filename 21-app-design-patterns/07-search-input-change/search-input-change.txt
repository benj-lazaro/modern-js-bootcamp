Searching The API On Input Change
---------------------------------
- When a user types on the text input 
    - Initiate search on OMDb API
        - To find corresponding list of movies

    - The problem with this implementation
        - It makes multiple requests for every single keypress
        - OMDb API allows ONLY 1000 requests per day

    - To address this concern
        - As soon as the user stops typing on the text input for a little bit of time
        - Then perform the request
