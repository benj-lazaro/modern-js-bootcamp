Handling Errored Responses
--------------------------
- Addressing the 'Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: movie is not iterable' error message
    - Occurred when entering a long random string in the text input field

    - It was learned that when the OMDb API returned no results
        - The returened data is NOT in the form of an array (or iterable)
        - But as an object with a property 'Error' with a value 'Movie not found'
        - As a result triggering a TypeError

- The seeach functionality with the OMDb API is NOT that great
    - Entering a partial name of the movie will return a "Movie not found" error
    - The OMDb API does not consider partial terms
        - It expects to provide a reasonable title of a movie
        - In order to return some kind of results

- To address this error
    - Refactor fetchData() and incorporate an if-statement 
        - To check the presence of an 'response.data.Error' in the returned data
        - If present, return an empty array
