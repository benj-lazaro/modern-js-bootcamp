Handling Empty Responses
------------------------
- The dropdown menu stays open when deleting via backspace an entry from the <input> element
    - The dropdown menu has no content inside it 

    - A check needed to be implemented in the onInput()
        - If no data has been returned from fetchDate()
        - Remove the 'is-active' class attribute from the dropdown menu
        - Immediately return away from this function
            - Prevents rendering an empty dropdown menu
