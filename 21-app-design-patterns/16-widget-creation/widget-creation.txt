Style Of Widget Creation
------------------------
- The current design of the autocomplete Widget
    - To get distinct coupling between the index.html and index.js
        - Both work closely together

    - In the event that either one's code is be changed (intentionally/unintentionally)
        - It might break the entire application


- A new design of the autocomplete Widget
    - Move the entire widget code to the JavaScript side of the application
    
    - It will require only one (1) <div> element with class of 'autocomplete'
        - In the HTML document (index.html)

    - Refactor index.js to search for the targeted <div> element
        - Then setup the entire autocomplete widget within itself
    
    - This allows creation of reusable widgets for future projects
        - Due to limited coupling between the HTML document & JavaScript code containing the widget


- New design implementation notes
    - In the index.html
        - Creating a <div> element with a class 'autocomplete'

    - In the index.js
        - Select the DOM element with class of 'autocomplete'
        - Create an <input> element
        - Add event handlers to the <input>
        - Perform the search (on the API)
        - Add the HTML code require to generate the dropmenu for the returned data
        - Add in options for menu
