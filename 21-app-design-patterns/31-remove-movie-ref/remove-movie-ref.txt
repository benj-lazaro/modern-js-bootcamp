Removing Movie References
-------------------------
- Extract the code that fetches data from the OMDb API from autocomplete.js
    - Specifically from the onInput codeblock

- Remove references to the specific data (movie) from the autocomplete.js

- To make the codebase of autocomplete.js generic and reusable to other projects
