Ensuring Files Exist
--------------------
- Remove the console.log() statement from the .action()
    - Uncomment debounce code, cut and paste into the .action() method

    - Update the "chokidar" events e.g. "change" & "unlink"
        - Change to referencing to the variable "start"

    - Check for a filename that has been passed as an argument value
        - If none, default to using "index.js"

        - Use the "fsPromises.access()" from the "file system" module
            - To check if the file exists on the local drive
            - Also checks the user's read or write permission on the file as well           
            - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fspromisesaccesspath-mode)

        - Implement a try-catch statement if the file does not exists
