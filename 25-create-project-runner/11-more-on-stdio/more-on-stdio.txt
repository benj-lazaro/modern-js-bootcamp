More On StdIO
-------------
- The basics of standard in (stdin), out (stdout) & error (stderr)
    - Every single program started or process created has its own three (3) separate channels
        - stdin     = optionally listens to incoming input
        - stdout    = communicates normal logs to the outside world (e.g. console.log() stmts)
        - stderr    = throws an error of any kind


- Whenever a child process is created
    - It does NOT have anywhere to send its own information channels (i.e. stdio) to

    - The "stdio" property assigned with the value of "inherit"
        - Forwards the child process' stdin, stdout & stderr back to the parent process
