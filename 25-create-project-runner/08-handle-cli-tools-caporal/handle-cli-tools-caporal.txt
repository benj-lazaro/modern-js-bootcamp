Handling CLI Tools With Caporal
-------------------------------
- Implement code to make use of the NPM package "caporal"
    - Access its methods to handle parameters passed into the CLI application
        - .command()    = use to handle "sub-commands" for the CLI app 
        - .argument()   = specifies an argument(s) that the CLI is going to take
        - .option()     = serves as an option flag
        - .action()     = runs the CLI app along with the required | optional arguments
                        = contains the code of the CLI application

    - NOTE: None of the aforementioned methods will execute until calling
        
        prog.parse(process.argv)

        - process.argv = array of arguments that are provided by the user on execution of the CLI app 


- Running the CLI app along the flag "-h"
    - Run the "help" system automatically generated by the "caporal" package
