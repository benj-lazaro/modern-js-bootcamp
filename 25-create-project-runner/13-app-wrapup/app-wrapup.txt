App Wrap Up
-----------
- Details a software bug of the app 
    - When placing logs emitted by the child process inside a setInterval()
    
    - Any changes made in the content of the targeted file
        - App will create a new process
        - Emit the logs forwarded by the child process to the parent process (i.e. the app)

    - However, the previous child process continues to emit its own logs
        - Prior to the logs emitted by the recently created child process 


- To address the bug
    - When the .spawn() method is called, it returns a child process object
        - Reference (https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#class-childprocess)

    - The child process object comes with a function .kill()
        - It sends a SIGTERM signal to the child process object
        - It returns true if it succeeds terminating thie child process
            - Otherwise, it returns a false
    
    - Save the current child process into a variable
        - When a new child process is created
        - It calls .kill() method FIRST
        - Then call the .spawn() in order to create a new child process
