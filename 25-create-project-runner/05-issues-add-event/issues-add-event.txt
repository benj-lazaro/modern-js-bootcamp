Issues With Add Event
---------------------
- The chokidar's "add" function presents an issue with the current app being developed

    - The watchit app starts up & watches over the targeted directory
        - The chokidar reports an "add" event

    - Starts up the user's code
        - The chokidar reports an "add" event

    - Stopped the user's program just created
        - Nothing is reported

    - Restart the user's code
        - The chokidar reports an "add" event

    - Stopped the user's program just created
        - Nothing is reported

    - Restart the user's code
        - The chokidar reports an "add" event

        - NOTE: This process continously repeats itself


- To get around this issue

    - The watchit app starts up & watches over the targeted directory
        - The instant that it adds a file rather than running it immediately
        - Wait for 100ms to go by
        - See if any other events get emitted

    - If any other events does get emitted
        - Restart the 100ms timer

    - If a 100ms goes by without any event emitted
        - Starts up the user's code

    - NOTE: Waiting for some time to pass before executing some code of our own
        - Is referred as to "bouncing" a function
