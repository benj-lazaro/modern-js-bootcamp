For..Of with Objects
--------------------
- The for..of loop works with iterables (e.g. arrays, string) BUT NOT Objects
    - An object is NOT ITERABLE 

- To use for..of loop in an object
    - Instead of accessing the entire object

    - Use Object.keys() method to access the object's keys

    - Use Object.values() method to access the correponding object key's value
        - OR use the object's key to access the correponding value
