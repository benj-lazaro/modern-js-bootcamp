Comparing For and For..Of Loops
-------------------------------
- For..Of loop are NOT recommended when 
    - Iteraing through an iterable where both of the element's index and value (data) are NEEDED
    - Regular for loop is more suited for this task

- For..Of loop is recommended when 
    - Iterating through an iterable where the element's value (data) ONLY is needed
