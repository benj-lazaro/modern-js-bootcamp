For..In Loops
-------------
- The for..in statement iterates all enumrable string properties (i.e. keys) of an object
    - It basically loop over the keys (properties) of an object
    - It iterates over the actual values in an array or string

- Arrays are technically objects, therefore can also be used in a for..in loop
    - However, it iterates through the array's properties (i.e indices) NOT the element values

    - Arrays are special objects where the keys are ORDERED set of indices numbers (begins at 0)
        - The order of for..in loops are NOT set in stone (i.e. arbitrary order)
        - The order changes from browser to browser
        - Therefore DO NO USE for..in with an array
        - Use a for..of loop instead
