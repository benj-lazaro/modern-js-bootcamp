More While Loops
----------------
- A while loop EXCELS at writing a loop wherein you DO NOT KNOW exaxtly how many time it is going to run

- A common implementation pattern of a while loop:

    while(some condition) {
        update or attempt to make the condition false
    }


    NOTE: Failing to make the condition false will result to an INFINITE LOOP
