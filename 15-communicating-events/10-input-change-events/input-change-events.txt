Input Change Events
-------------------
- Events that allows to capture data types or changes on a form element
    - Without having to wait for a 'submit' event

    - Keeps in-sync with the form element
        - To know exactly what is happening on each form element

    - Use case
        - Simultaneously display each character typed on a form element
            - On a separate element (e.g. displaying type credit card nmber) 
            - BEFORE the user clicks the 'Submit' button

- Event 'input'
    - Captures each character typed by the user in an <input> of 'type' element
    - Captures the current clicked status of a checkbox element
    - Captures the current element <item> element

- Event 'change'
    - Works pretty much the same as the 'input' event on most form elements
    - EXCEPT for the <input> element of type 'text'
        - Will NOT immediately remain in-sync as the user types
        - UNTIL the cursor loses 'focus' or blurs from the <input> element

- The code pattern demonstrated in the example is commonly seen in React or other framework
    - Uses the 'name' attribute of an element as a key
        - To store the corresponding assigned value
    - Creates an object that contains all of the form data at once
