Two Ways NOT To Add Events
--------------------------
- All events follow the same pattern
    - Each event are TRIGGERED differently
    - BUT follow the same pattern when incorporating it into code
        - Targeted element (e.g. button, image)
        - Event type (e.g. click, hover)
        - Calls the code (function / method) for the corresponding action

- It is NOT proper to add an event
    - Using an Inline Event Handler
        - Corresponding HTML (event) attribute on targeted element
        - Assign a string representing inline JavaScript code / function

        - Follows the pattern:
            on<eventName> = "<code_to_do_somethng>"

    - Using the selected element's .on<properties>
        - Select the targeted element
        - Set the element's corresponding .on<property>
        - Assign the corresponding JavaScript code

        - Need to keep track the list of .on<properties>
            - Writen in lowercase despite JavaScript promoting camelCase
            - It can be quite confusing

        - Need to using console.dir() on the selected element
            - To display the list of corresponding properties to use
