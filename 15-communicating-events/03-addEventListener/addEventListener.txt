.addEventListener
-----------------
- It is a method of the EventTarget interface
    - It sets up a function that will be called
    - Whenever an event occurs on the selected element

- The common targets are:
    - Elements or its children
    - Document
    - Window
    - Any object that support events (e.g. XMLHttpRequest)

- The MOST RECOMMENDED way to register an Event Listener
    - It allows to add more than one handler for an event
    - It allows to listen to multiple events of the same type, on one element
    - It works on any event target, NOT just HTML or SVG elements
