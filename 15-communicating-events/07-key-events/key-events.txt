    - keyup     = fired when a key is released; any key
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keyup_event)

    - keydown   = fired when a key is pressed; any key
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event)

- The event keypress
    - A deprecated key event but still has its uses (see NOTE)
    - Behavior differs from browser to browser
    - Unable to detect SHIFT, CAPS LOCK, arrow keys

    - NOTE: Useful for detecting 'Enter' key; it detects a single key press
        - Due to events keydown & keyup detects two successive key presses

- NOTE: The event keyup does NOT recognize the key 'tab' WHEN
    - The cursor is focused or within targeted element

    - Pressing 'tab' moves the focus away from the target element (object)
        - Prevents it from detecting succeeding key events
