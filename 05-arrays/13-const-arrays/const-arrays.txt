Using const with arrays
-----------------------
- Arrays are reference types
- The actual array value is NOT STORED in a variable
- The variable stores the reference (address) where the actual array value is located

- The values in an array CAN CHANGE as long as the reference (address) REMAINS the same

- The const keyword ensure that the reference stored in the constant variable will NOT be CHANGED
    - const is used ALL THE TIME when working with reference types (e.g. arrays)


Example
-------
const = myEggs["brown", "brown"];
myEggs.push("purple");
