.splice() method
----------------
- The .splice() method allows to insert, remove or replace element(s) of an array in place.

- It accepts three argument values:
    - A start index 
    - A delete count = how many array elements to be deleted
    - Array element(s) to be inserted to or replaced on the array

- It returns an array that contains the deleted elements
    - If one item was removed, it returns an array with a single element
    - If NO item was removed, it returns an empty array 

- To create a new array with a segment removed or replaced WITHOUT MUTATING the original array
    - Use .toSpliced() method instead
