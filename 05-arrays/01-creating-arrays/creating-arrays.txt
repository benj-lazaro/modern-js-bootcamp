Creating Arrays
---------------
- An array is an ordered collection of values (e.g. blog post comments, songs in a playlist, etc.)

- It is resizeable and can contain different data types including another array
- It is zero-indexed (starts with 0)

- It is NOT an associative array
    - Array items can NOT be accessed using arbitrary string as index
    - Non-negative integer is used as index

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)


Syntax
------
// Creates an empty array
let <variable_name> = [];
let <variable_name> = new Array();   

// An array of strings
let colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"];

// An array of integers
let lottoNums = [19, 22, 56, 12, 51];

// A mixed array
let stuff = [true, 68, "cat", null];
