Promise.all()
-------------
- A static helper method that accepts an array or iterable of promises (input)
    - Then returns a single Promise

- The returned single Promise is fulfilled when
    - All of the passed promises have been fulfilled / resolved
    - The values of the returned promise objects are saved as elements of an array
    - The values are then assigned to a variable for processing

- The async and await make asynchronous code looks like synchronous
    - BUT behaves asynchronously
    - Makes it easier for the code to be read
    - It is built on top of promises hidden behind syntatic sugar

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)
