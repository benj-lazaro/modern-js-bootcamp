await
-----
- A keyword placed inside an async function
    - It pauses the execution of the function

    - It waits for a promise to be resolved 
        - Without the need to use a .next() method

    - It still uses promises in the background

    - NOTE: ONLY works WITHIN an async function

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
