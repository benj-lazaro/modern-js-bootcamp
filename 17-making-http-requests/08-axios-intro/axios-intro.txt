Axios Introduction
------------------
- It is a 3rd party promise-based library for making HTTP requests
    - It uses fetch() behind the scenes

    - It removes the 'minor' pains using fetch()
        - Checking on the returned HTTP status codes after the request
            - Handles resolved promise object through the .then() method
            - Handles rejected promise object / HTTP errors (e.g. 404) through the .catch() method
            
            - fetch() does NOT reject HTTP errors
    
        - Parsing returned promised object in JSON format

    - It is an isomorphic application
        - Can run on the browser and node.js with the same codebase

- To install Axios via CDN:
