JSON XML
--------
- JSON & XML are two ways of formattng data
    - That can be sent from a server to another server or server to a browser
    - A way to format information
    - A common standard way of sending information

- XML = eXtensible Markup Language
    - It is a markup language
        - Rarely used these days

    - It defines a set for encoding documents
        - In a format that is both human & machine-readable

    - It is a broad way of structuring data

    - It looks similarly to that of the HTML
        - Except the element names are very different
        - The elements themselves are NOT actually elements
        
    - JavaScript can parse XML and turn into a JavaScript object


- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
    - It is another format for sending data
        - Extremely common these days

    - It is NOT JavaScript
        - It LOOKS LIKE JavaScript

    - Every key in JSON MUST be a string enclosed in quotes
        - It uses colon ':' instead of an object '{ }'
        - It can use arrays
        - It can have values like numbers, boolean, strings
        - It can NOT store functions

    - It is easy to translate from JSON to JavaScript
        - Other languages besides JavaScript can read / parse JSON

    - There are available online tools that format & validates JSON
        - JSON Formatter & Validator (https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#)
