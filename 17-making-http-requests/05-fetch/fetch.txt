fetch()
-------
- It is a global method that starts the process of fetching a resource from the network
    - Returns a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available

    - The promise resolves to the 'Response' object
        - Representing the response to the rquest

- The promise object ONLY rejects when a network error is encountered
    - It does NOT reject on HTTP errors

    - To do so, a .then() handler MUST check for the following properties
        - response.ok
        - response.status

    - The .catch() will ONLY run
        - If there is a NETWORK ERROR
        - Anything that prevented the request from completing or getting a response

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)
