Intro To AJAX
-------------
- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
    - It is an approach using a number of existing technologies together
        - HTML / XHTML
        - CSS
        - JavaScript
        - DOM
        - XML
        - XSLT
        - XMLHttpRequest object

    - In order to get information from an API

- Modern day AJAX does NOT use XML anymore 
    - Replaces XML with JSON
    - JSON = a format for sending data as text using JSON notation

- JSON Notation is a way of formating, representing and sharing data
    - That can be used in JavaScript
    - It is easy to take JSON and turn it into JavaScript
        - To do something with it
    
- With AJAX, web applications are able to 
    - Make quick, incremental updates to the user interface
    - Without reloading the entire browser page (e.g. single-page web application)
    - Makes it faster and more responsive to user actions
