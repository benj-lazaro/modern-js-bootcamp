XMLHttpRequests The Basics
--------------------------
- XMLHttpRequest objects in the browser that are used to interact with servers
    - To send / fetch / data to / from a URL without having to do a full page refresh
    - Abbreviately known as XHRs

- The original way of sending requests via JavaScript
    - It does NOT support promises
    - It uses LOTS of callbacks
    - It has a clunky & hard to remember syntax

- The 'XML' name part is just a relic
    - When XML was a standard
