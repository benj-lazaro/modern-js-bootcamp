Rest Parameters
---------------
- It allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array

- It looks like spread BUT it is NOT
    - It uses the same ... operatpr but BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY
    - It is almost the opposite of spread
    - It collects things (instead of spreading out) down into a single array

- Use case:
    - Functions that accept an unlimited number of arguments (e.g. Math.max())


Arguments Object 
----------------
- It is an array-like object accessible inside functions
  - It contains the values of arguments passed to that function
  - It has an array-like length property

  - It does NOT have array methods .push() or .pop()
    - If needed, convert arguments into a real array using spread (i.e. ...arguments)

- It is the OLD WAY of implementing a function with unlimited number of arguments
  - In modern code, rest parameters is PREFERRED
  
- It is NOT AVAILABLE inside arrow functions
