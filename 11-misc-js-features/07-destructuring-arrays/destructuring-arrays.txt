Destructing Arrays
------------------
- A short, clean syntax to 'unpack' values from data structures into separate, distinct variables
    - Elements from an array 
    - Properties from an object

- The new variables will be created in the order based on
    - The elements position in the array

- To select specific elements from the array
    - Insert a blank space (separate by a comma) in the array of distinct variables

- To collect the rest of the argument values, use rest ...


Syntax 
------
const [a, b] = array;
