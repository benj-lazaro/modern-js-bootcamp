Spread For Function Calls
-------------------------
- The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable (e.g. array, string) to be EXPANDED where 
    - Zero or more arguments for function calls are expected
    - Zero or more elements for array literals are expected
    - Zero or more key-value pairs for object literals are expected

- It basically means expanding some iterable (array, string, etc.) 
    - Into some other destination

- Spread is syntically represented by ...
    - Behaves differently depending on where they are used for (function call, array or object)

- When spread is passed as an argument value in a function call
    - Spread takes the associated iterable
    - Breaks it up into individual argument values

- NOTE: spread (...) is NOT SUPPORTED in Internet Explorer

Syntax 
------
myFunction(a, ...iterableObj, b)        // Spread for function call

[1, ...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]     // Spread for array literal

{ ...obj, key: 'value' }                // Spread for object literal
