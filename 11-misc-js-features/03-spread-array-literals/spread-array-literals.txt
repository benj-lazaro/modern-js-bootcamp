Spread In Array Literals 
------------------------
- The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable (e.g. array, string) to be EXPANDED where 
    - Zero or more elements for array literals are expected

- Spread iterates through an array literal
    - Copy each existing element into a new array

- Common use case
    - Make a clone of an existing array
    - Nested arrays will NOT be cloned

- The new array will have a unique reference different from the original array
    - Using === operator to check for equality will result to false
    - As each references a different array in memory

- The new array follows the order of elements from the original array(s)

- The spread serves as a shorter version of the array method .concat()
