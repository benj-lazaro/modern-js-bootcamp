.innerText
----------
- A property of the HTMLElement interface
    - It represents the rendered text content of a node & its descendants
    - It does NOT preserve the formatting of the content within the HTML document

    - It is aware of the text content being shown (or rendered) on the web browser
        - It is aware of things like <br> elements
    
    - It ignores hidden elements (e.g. inline CSS property = display:none)
    - It is NOT able to read the text content of the <script> & <style> tags

- As a getter
    - It copies the text content of the element

- As a setter
    - It replaces the element's children with the given value
    - It converts line breaks into <br> elements

.textContent
------------
- A property of the Node interface
    - It represents the text content of the node & its descendants
    
    - It returns the content of ALL elements including <script> and <style> elements
        - It preserves the formatting of the content within the HTML document
        - It renders the text content directly from the actual HTML document
    
    - It returns the text content of hidden elements
    - It returns the text content of the <script> & <style> tags

- The .textContent property is faster
    - Although the speed difference against the .innerText property is imperceptible
    - It does NOT parse the content as HTML
