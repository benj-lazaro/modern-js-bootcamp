Altering Styles
---------------
- Manipulating CSS properties using JavaScript and the DOM using the .style property


.style
------
- It is a READ-ONLY property of the HTMLElement
    - It returns the inline style of an element    
    
    - In the form of a live CSSStyleDeclaration object
        - The object contains a list of style properties of that element
        - Styles defined on the element's INLINE 'style' attribute

- It can be used to change the INLINE style of an element
    - One style property at a time
    - Can use a loop to implement changes on related elements' INLINE 'style' attribute

- It does NOT read the styles defined in an external CSS file 

- NOTE: CSS properties in JavaScript uses camelcase & does NOT recognize '-'
    - The '-' is NOT a valid identifier
    - Some CSS properties use '-' (e.g. background-color)

    - Use the camelcase version of the CSS property by removing '-'
    - Then camelcase the property (e.g. backgroundColor)

    - Any property in the CSSStyleDeclaration object that is more than 1 word
        - Is presented in their camelcase version
