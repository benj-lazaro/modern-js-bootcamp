Behind The Scenes Of Requests
-----------------------------
- Behind the scenes after the web browser made a request to the web server app
    - Client web browser assembled a network request
        - Disassembles the URL (http://localhost:3000/) into the following properties
            - Host of "localhost"
            - Port of 3000
            - Path of "/" (default value if not specified)
            - HTTP method of "GET"

        
     - Client browser hands off the HTTP request to the operating system 
        - Sends out the HTTP request to the target Host
        
        - If the target host is other than "localhost"
            - HTTP request is sent to a DNS server (publicly available)
            - Maps hostnames with corresponding IP addresses
            - DNS server sends back the corresponding IP address 
            - The operating system send the request to the said IP address 
        
        - If the target host is "localhost"
            - The operating system does NOT reach out to a DNS server

            - The operating system takes a look at the specified port of the request
                - NOTE: The computer has around 65,000 ports available for use
                - Ports are essentially little communication channels

            - Forwards the request to the specified port number


    - Express web server receives the HTTP request forwarded by the operating system
        - Express web server is configured to listen at port number port 3000
            - NOTE: Port 3000 is the convention used in development
        
        - Receives the incoming HTTP request
            - Retrieves the following data from the request
                - Requested path of "/"
                - Requested method of "GET"

        - Express hands over the request to the router object
            - It takes a look at the path (e.g. "/") and method (e.g. "GET")
            - Forwards the request to the appropriate route handler 
            - Which then calls the corresponding callback function     


    - Express formulates a response (from the callback function)
        - Sends the response back to the client web browser
