Parsing Form Data
-----------------
- Implement code to access the information that get sent along with the POST request
    - Retrieved from the body of the request


- Behind the scenes of a request from the client browser to the web server
    - Browser sends HTTP header to the server
        - The server has NOT received the entire request as of this time

    - Server sees the request with path & method of the request
        - The server has NOT received the entire request as of this time

    - Server runs appropriate callback method
        - The server has NOT received the entire request as of this time

    - Then the browser starts transmitting information from the body of request

    - Browser sends a little chunck of information
        - Sends a chunk of data inside the form over to the server bit by bit
        - Waits for confirmation from the server 
        - This step is repeated several times

        - NOTE: This part of the process that will be implemented in index.js

    - Until all chuncks have been sent over and the request is complete
