Parsing Form Data
-----------------
- Refactor code in order to access data from the body of request


- The following is the behind the scenes of the request
    - Client browser sends a HTTP server to the web server
        - At this time, the server has NOT received the entire request 

    - Web server sees the request along with the path and method (e.g. GET, POST)
        - At this time, the server has NOT received the entire request 

    - Web server responds by running the corresponding callback method
        - At this time, the server has NOT received the entire request

    - Client browser starts transmitting information from the body of the request
        - It sends little chuncks of information to the web server
        - Client browser waits for confirmation of receipt from the web server

        - NOTE: This setup is repeated several times

    - All of the chuncks of data have been sent over to the web server
        - The request is COMPLETE
