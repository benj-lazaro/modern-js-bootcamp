Creating A Web Server
---------------------
- Node.js can run a web server
    - Accepts incoming HTTP requests out of the box
        - It has function from the standard library that receive network requests
        - However offers limited features

    - The Express is a library or web framework that sets up a full featured web server
        - It receives network requests and respond to them
        - Same with the functions offered by the Node Standard Library but with more features
        - Reference (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
        - Website (https://expressjs.com/)


- Refactor "index.js" to set up a new web server using "express"
    - Require the "express" library
    - Define an "app" object
    - Define a handler for the "root" route
    - Start listening for incoming requests


- Run the app / the web server

    npm run dev

    - In the event that you'll encounter a "EADDRINUSE" error
        - It meant that another app or process is currently using the same defined port number

        - To address this error
            - Stop the other app / process
              OR
            - Define a different port number (e.g. 3001)
        
            - Then restart your web server 


- Access the web server on http://localhost:3000/
