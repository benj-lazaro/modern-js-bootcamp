Globally Applying Middleware
----------------------------
- Replace the helper function (middleware) with a library
    - To address big holes in the implementation

    - In particular, there are other requests that have bodies
        - The current helper function handles POST requests
        - Likely conflict with other request handlers that will be implementated later on

    - Use the library "body-parser"
        - Use the .urlencoded() method
        - Pass in the object { extended: true} as an argument value

    - The .urlencoded() handles specific information coming out of an HTML form
        - The logic behind this method is identical to the previously created helper function

        - It takes an incoming request
            - Receives the body of the request bit by bit
            - Parse it
            - Put all the information together
            - Make the information available on the "req.body" property

        - It automatically detects the type of incoming request (e.g. GET, POST)


- Refactor index.js 
    - To ensure that every single request
        - Gets automatically parsed
        
        - Refrain from copy-paste bodyParser.urlencoded() for every route handler
        - Move it into app.use() as an argument value
        
        - Ensures that the bodyParser.urlencoded() to be available to every route handler 
            - Parsed data is accessible from the "req.body" property
