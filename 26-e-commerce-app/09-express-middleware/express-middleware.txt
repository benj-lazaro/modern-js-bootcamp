Middlewares In Express
----------------------
- Refactor the callback function of the root's route handler for a POST request
    - Place it into a separate helper function
        - Retaining the logic on parsing the information incldued in the request
        
    - Reason being is that as the app scales up 
        - The logic of parsing information in the request becomes repetitive for each route handler

    - The helper function handles information parsing from a POST request
        - It is called BEFORE the corresponding callback function of a route handler 
        - Receives all information from the body of the request       
        - Returns the parsed data to the route handler's callback function


- The helper function is referred as a "middleware" function in Express
    - It is a function that preprocess the request and/or response object
    
    - Think of it as a function in the middle of a request handler

    - It requires three (3) different arguments
        - req   = request object
        - res   = response object
        - next  = a function that is called when the helper function is done processing
                = Informs Express to hand back control to the route handler's callback function

    - A route handler can accept multiple helper functions (middlewares)


- Later replace the helper (middleware) function with a 3rd-party library
