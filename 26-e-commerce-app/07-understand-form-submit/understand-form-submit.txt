Understanding Form Submissions
------------------------------
- Behind the scenes an how a web browser treats an HTML form 

- Whenever a form's submit button is clicked or hit enter
    - The client web browser performs an automatic submission
        - Browser looks at the <form> element
        
        - Find the <input> element(s) inside it
        
        - Attempt to collect all the information from each <input> element(s)
            - That has a "name" property assigned to it (them)
            - NOTE: Without a "name" property, information will NOT BE COLLECTED

    - Browser forms the collected information into a "query string"
        - Evident on the URL right after the "?"
        - The "name" property along with the assigned value

    - Browser executes a GET method request to the URL's web server


- The Express module / web server can be configured to receive a "query string"
    - Takes a look & retrieve the value(s) of each "name" property

    - By creating a route handler assigned with the app.post() method


- The HTTP method POST slightly changes the default behavior of the browser
    - A HTTP request method associated in creating a record of some kind
        - Such as a blog post, image upload or creating a new user account

    - After submitting the "query string" to the web server
        - The information is NO longer placed in the URL

        - It is appended into the request body after the form's data is submitted
            - Data viewed using Google Chrome's dev tools
            - Network -> Payload -> Form Data
