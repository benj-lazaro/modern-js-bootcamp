App Architecture
----------------
- The overall architecture of the app is as follows
    - Build a Node.js web server
        - Initially hosted locally
        - Configured to receive network requests
        - Inspects the requests
        - Decides what resources the user is looking for
        - Send the requested resource (HTML document) back to the client browser
            - HTML document dynamically assembled per request on the server

        - Accessible from a web browser
            - Makes a network request to the web server

    - Build a custom file-based data store
        - Store different items to be sold
        - Store different items in a user's shopping cart
        - Store user information who signed up as adminsitrators


- Initial project setup
    - Create a new project directory
    - Generate a package.json file
    - Install dependencies to help build the project
    - Create a 'start' script (in the package.json file) 
        - Used to run the project

    - NOTE: These are common steps in building Node.js projects
