Exposing Public Directories
---------------------------
- Implement code that would instruct Express.js to find the pre-made CSS file
    - Send the file back to the client web browser
    - To implement the styling for the entire web application


- Create a directory named "public" within the root directory of the web application
    - This folder will be "exposed" to the outside world
    - Any file or sub-folder will be freely accessed by the client web browser

    - This folder will contain files that is intended for public consumption
        - CSS file
        - Image file(s)
        - Font(s)
        - JavaScript code (intended to be executed by the client web browser)

    - NOTE: NEVER place any file(s) that are NOT meant for public viewing / use


- Create a directory named "css" within the "public" directory
    - Paste the pre-made CSS file (main.css) within this directory


- Instruct Express.js to make the "public" directory available to the outside world
    - Refactor index.js
    - Implement app.use() to wire up the "css" directory
        - Pass "public" as an argument value

    - Every request coming from a client browser
        - Express.js will look inside this directory every single time
