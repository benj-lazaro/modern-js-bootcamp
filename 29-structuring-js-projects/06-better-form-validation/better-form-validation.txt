Adding Better Form Validation
-----------------------------
- Address the last issue with the current codebase
    - When an incorrect email address or password is used to login
        - A corresponding error message is generated
        - BUT requires the user to click the "back" button
            - To return to the login page 

        - Instead of generating a corresponding error message
            - While remaining on the same login page

    - To create a repeatable solution that handle validation
        - That can be implemented on different forms to be created
        - Produce reasonable feedback message to the user
        - Show the message on the corresponding views

    - Use a 3rd-party library named "Express Validator" 
        - It helps validate the contents of the form
