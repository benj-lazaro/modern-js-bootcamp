HTML Reuse With Layouts
-----------------------
- Address current deficiencies
    - Relying on the client browser to interpret the received partial HTML code from the server
        - Refactor the code in order for the server to send over an entire valid HTML document (<html>, <head> and all..)
            - Refactor "signin.js" and "signup.js" files


    - Noted that during the completion of HTML code is the re-occurrence of identical pieces of HTML elements
        - Both "signin.js" and "signup.js" have identical HTML structures

        - Address the problem by creating a layout file
            - It is a file the contains all of the standard HTML elements inside a document
