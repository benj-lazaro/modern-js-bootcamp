Adding Custom Validators
------------------------
- Refactor validation logic of the POST request handler for the "signup" route
    - Write a custom validator that merges earlier validator code with the validation chains
        - Checks for the existence of a user email address in the repository
        - Checks if the user password matches with the passwordConfirmation value
        
    - Custom validator is a function to be added to the express-validation's validation chains
        - Throws an error when something is NOT quite right with the checks
        - In return express-validation interprets it (error) as something went wrong

        - Chain the function .custom()
            - Pass a callback function that will be used to validate
                - Existence of provided email address in the repository
                - Value of password and passwordConfirmation matches
