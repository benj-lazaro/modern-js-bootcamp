Using This In Methods
---------------------
- On an object literal
    - The keyword 'this' refers to the object's current execution scope
        - Does NOT reference to the global scope object 'window'

    - It references the current execution scope of the object's methods & properties

    - It provides the ability to write a method
        - That is aware of the object it lives it
        - That interacts with other properties & methods 

    - It provides a self-contained world
