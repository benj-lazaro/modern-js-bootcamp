Method Shorthand Syntax
-----------------------
- Instead of using a key-value syntax when defining methods inside an object literal
    - Give it a name w/c will be used to create the key
    - Do away the : after the method name
    - The comma is used to separate other methods or properties defined within the object literal

- This method of adding method(s) in an object literal is much cleaner

- It is NOT COMMON to use an arrow function when defining methods in an object literal
    - This is similar to the old method of adding method
    - It clutters the code

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
