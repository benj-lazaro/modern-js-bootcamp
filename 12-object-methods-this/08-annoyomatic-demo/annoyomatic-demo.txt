- Arrow function suck as regular function (method) w/in an object literal
    - NOT having it's own 'this' can be advantageous

    - It is good when dealing with nested functions (methods) and callbacks
        - As well as handling different execution context (e.g. parent object VS 'window')

    - The 'this' inside an arrow function (method) of an object literal
        - Will be identical the value of 'this' referencing the parent object literal
