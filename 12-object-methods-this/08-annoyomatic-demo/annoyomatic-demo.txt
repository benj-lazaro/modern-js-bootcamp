- An arrow function does NOT have its own (flexible) version of 'this'
    - Current execution scope = the browser's global scope object 'window'
    - Regardlesss of the Invocation Context used

- An arrow function can be useful when 
    - Dealing with nested functions and callbacks
    - Handling different current execution scopes

- If an arrow function is defined within a normal function (method) inside an object literal
    - The value of 'this' is altered by the method's current execution scope
    - Current execution scope = the object literal itself
