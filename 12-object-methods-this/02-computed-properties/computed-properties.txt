Computed Properties
-------------------
- An improvement for object literal syntax
    - Adds a property with a dynamic key
    - Uses a variable as a key name in an object literal property

- To use computed properties
    - In the object liteeral's property definition
        - Wrap the variable name within a pair of [ ] to serve as a dyanmic key
        - JavaScript evaluates the variable first
        - Then the variable name replaced with its assigned value
        - This now serves as a property name (or key)

- It is possible to use complex expression as a dynamic key


Example
-------
const user = "Jools";

const userRoles = {
    // Wraps the variable within a pair of [ ] to become a dyanmic key
    // Variable user will become the propery (key) name 'Jools'
    // Gets assigned with the value "Admin"
    [user]: "Admin"
}

console.log(userRoles);     // Returns {Jools: "Admin"}
