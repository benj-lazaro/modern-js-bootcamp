Putting It All Togerther: Deck Of Cards
---------------------------------------
- The disadvantages of using a function based approach in writing code
    - Requires passing related values around function(s) as arguments
    - Promotes long and inflexible code

- Using an object based approach is a great way of organzing your code
    - Grouping relevant values with functionality

    - The object stores the values (in corresponding properties)
    - The object's methods work on those values
        - Thanks to the keyword 'this'

    - There is NO need to 'return' value(s) from an object literal's method
        - Since it is interacting with the object literal's property

        - In a pure function approach
            - The processed value(s) disappears into obliviou after leaving the function
            - Unless the value is return back to calling code
