Introduction To Keyword This
----------------------------
- The keyword 'this' is a reference to an object
    - That object represents the current execution scope

- The keyword 'this' returns an object
    - The returned object changes depending on the scope and rules 
    - As well as on how a function is called

    - This is the confusing part
        - The returned object often references to the global scope
        - Global scope on browsers = 'window' object

- On a regular function
    - The keyword 'this' refers to the global scoped object of the browser = 'window' object

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

- NOTE: Declaring a variable using the keyword 'var'
    - The variable is added to the global scope of the browser = 'window' object
    - The variable becomes a property of the 'window' object

    - Variables defined using keywords 'let' and 'const'
        - Are NOT added to the global scope of the browser
        - It does NOT become a propery of the 'window' object
