Ternary Operator
----------------
- The only JavaScript operator that takes 3 operands
    - A condition followed by a ?
    - An expression if thecondition evaluates to truthy 
    - Followed by a :
    - An expression if the condition evaluates to falsy

- Basically, turning an if-else statement into a single-line of code
    - This ONLY works if the conditional is answerable by a simple yes (true) or no (false)


Syntax
------
<condition> ? <exprIfTrue> : <exprIfFalse?
