Double Equals
-------------
- A comparison operator that checks the equality of the values being compared but NOT their type
- It coerces (converts) values being compared to the SAME TYPE and then compares them

==      // equality
!=      // not equal


Examples
--------
> 4 == 4
< true

> 'a' == 'a'
< true

> false == false
< true

> 0 == false        // both values are falsy
< true

> 7 == '7'          // == operator converts them to a common type & then compare their values
< true
