Double Equals
-------------
- Refers to the 4 equality (comparison) operators that focuses on equality and inequality

==      // equality
!=      // not equal
===     // strict equality
!==     // strict non-equality


== vs ===
---------
- == checks for equality of value and NOT equality of type
- It converts both values to the SAME TYPE and then compares them
- This can lead to unexpected results

- === checks for both equality of value and type

Examples
--------
> 4 == 4
< true

> 'a' == 'a'
< true

> false == false
< true

> 0 == false        // both values are falsy
< true

> 7 == '7'          // == operator converts them to a common type & then compare their values
< true

> 7 === '7'         // === operator compares both type and value
< false

> 0 == ''
< true

> 0 === ''
< false

> null == undefined
< true

> null === undefined
< false
