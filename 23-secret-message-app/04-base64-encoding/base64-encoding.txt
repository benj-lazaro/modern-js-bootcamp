Base64 Encoding
---------------
- Implement code that handles the "encryption" of the user-submitted clear text
    - Using Base64 encoding


- How Base64 encoding works
    - ASCII character codes
        - These characters are represented with a decimal value 0 to 127
        - Characters "a-z", "A-Z", 0-9, !@#$%^&*()

    - Base64 character codes
        - These characters are characters represented with a decimal value 0 to 63
        - Similar to ASCII characters except supports fewer characters
        - Characters "a-z", "A-Z", 0-9


- How the Base64 translation works
    - Convert each character it into their respective ASCII code
    - Convert each ASCII code into their 8-bit binary representation
    - Join all of the 8-bit binary representations together
    - Split the entirety into groups of 6 characters each (converting into Base64)
    - Convert each group of 6 characters into their corresponding character
