Welcome to Callback Hell
------------------------
- Callbacks are NOT perfect
    - They can get messy very quickly

- Old JavaScript way of doing asynchronous callbacks (or specifically, making requests)
    - Requires two callbacks 
        - onSuccess
        - onFailure

    - Implementing it results to 
        - Densely nested
        - Difficult to follow
        - Messy (hard to read) code


.getBoundingClientRect()
------------------------
- A method of the Element interface
    - Returns a DOMRect object
    - Provides information about the size of an element object & its position relative to the viewport
