Returning Promises From Functions
---------------------------------
- A function (or function expression) can return a promise object
    - Then save the returned promise object into a variable

    - Call the variable with the corresponding callbacks attached (resolve & reject)
        - That interacts with the promise object based on its status (fulfilled or rejected)
        - Execute the corresponding code
